# Green
Everyone has the right to live in a great place. More importantly,everyone has the right to contribute to making the place where they already live great. 

In our day-to-day life we experience many complications due to improper and insufficient waste management. Around 57% of the accumulated wastes are produced from house-holds. 
This is caused due to insufficient knowledge and lack of understanding about waste disposal technologies. If we can provide info to the public on how and where to dispose-off these wastes we can dramatically reduce waste accumulation. Thus increasing the chance of survival of the upcoming generation and providing a safer and cleaner planet.
SO.....we try to implement the later by introduce our app, ”GREEN ZONE”  . Our aim to provide a new definition for sustainability.
We aim to sent nothing to landfill. Reduce what we need and reuse as much as we can.

Our App detects and indicates waste disposal units closest and quickest to the user so that he/she have the power to dispose off their waste easily.
There are major three types of wastes 
1.E-waste 
2.Organic waste 
3.Inorganic wastes

This App provides the feature to sort and dispose waste according to their types.  
The user also get the feature to add their nearest waste disposal unit with verification from our server.
We where in inspired by the concept of 'Zero Waste' that we imitated its concept.
i.e. maximize recycling and minimize wastage. 

We developed a mechanism in which the user can register for waste pick up (agents form nearby private sector/public sector arrives at your doorstep to pick up the waste, transportation charges may be applied.)

Farmers and bio-gas plant owners have the privilege to search and find organic wastes for their needs.   

The app also provides fact and news related to current world affairs related to waste management thus providing and increasing the user's knowledge on sustainable development.
